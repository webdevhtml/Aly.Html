     "ALONE TIME"
  </h1>
  <p> 

Just thinking of socializing with people or going to crowded places can already make me feel drained. Not that I am saying I hate interacting with anyone, but my social battery isn't that high, I couldn't even last for an hour being with them. I just prefer being alone in my house, do whatever I feel like doing. The first thing I do in my alone time is definitely listening to music and daydream, I would live in my fantasy world for hours, imagining myself in a peaceful place with a peaceful background music. Second is digital drawing, I mostly draw fictional characters that are created by me, they are known as OCs or Original Characters, the artworks I made of them are mostly about their stories or backstories. Then, when I still have nothing else to do in my house, I would go outside somewhere peaceful, somewhere no loud noise can be heard, and no people but myself. Surrounded by plants and trees, the warmth of the sun welcoming me along with the cool breeze is the best feeling. And lastly, I would sleep in my alone time. This is where I am charging myself from all the exhausting activities. I rarely have dreams, but it just feels nice and comforting when you are laying on your soft bed and have no thoughts in your head.</p>
